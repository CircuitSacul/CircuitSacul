# Hello, I'm Circuit.
I'm 16 years old, and I've been programming since I was 11. I code mostly in python, I know a decent ammount of HTML/CSS/JavaScript (python > js btw). I own the Discord bot called [Starboard](https://top.gg/bot/700796664276844612), which I spend most of my free time working on.

On a side note, following the discontinuation of discord.py and the new features + restrictions discord is imposing, I'm likely going to start over with the rewrite of Starboard-2. I'll finish Starboard-2, probably get slash commands and threads working (through a fork of discord.py like nextcord or pycord), and then start Starboard-3 using Hikari. I'll be doing a few things differently this time, feel free to check progress at https://github.com/TrigonDev.

My Discord username is **Circuit#3397**. Note that I will **NOT** accept friend requests. If you wish to contact me, please join [this server](https://discord.gg/dGAzZDaTS9) first.

I've also been spending time contributing to hikari-crescent, which is a command handler that seems very promising (way simpler than tanjun or lightbulb). You can check it out at https://github.com/Lunarmagpie/hikari-crescent.
